# double_podium WIP

Mouse-friendly symmetrical ortholinear keyboard layout implemented in QMK

## Goals

Mouse friendly, i.e. most actions, characters and symbols are under left hand. If needed, they are then also provided in a more convenient way involving the right hand, or both. 
And additionally, navigation, common shortcuts and others are also available for right hand-only operation, often by mirroring the left half. 

No Tap-Hold on regular keys as I believe it's not without issues. I use Tap-Hold on combos, though, as these are pressed slower and separately anyway.

## Concepts

### Double podium

Putting a layer activator under lowest pinkie allows a comfortable podium-style navigation cluster at home row when in one-hand operation. 
And when using both hands, the two clusters can have complementary functions dependant on the layer and modifiers.<br>
At least to me, holding a layer with a pinkie, especially for longer time, feels more natural (read: healthier) than with a thumb.<br>
As the number of keys available for modifiers is limited, the two pinkie-keys also serve as CTRL and ALT â€” holding Space key in addition achieves that.

### Combos

Combos are used to send symbols, modifiers and others using just the left hand. Many of them are then mirrored on the right side. I find this very convenient: 
You memorize both sides easily and the mind freely chooses depending on which hand's turn it is or just general convenience (like opposite to the modifier in use).

Many combos are implemented using tap-dance to achieve tap-or-hold operation. The resultig experience is similar to a smartphone keyboard - you hold it down 
until the alternative character is produced. Other combos actually simply repeat the character. These are used for some symbols you might actually want to repeat, like drawing a line of dashes etc.
Holding Shift can also modify combos (it sends *any* character, not just the previous one shifted). Accordingly, a maximum of four characters is shown per a combo on the renders below.

These renders are a simplified representation of some of the combos used. Included are features which are less likely to change.

When a NAV layer is on, these combos support it:

Modifiers on held combos. These also have their respective mini-layers with just the adjacent Tab key.

Depending on the layer and modifiers applied the two clusters will optimally have complementary functions when using both hands. 
The two pinkie-keys are also serving as modifiers (CTRL and ALT) .

I have slightly different (and lower) keycaps on these pinkie-keys so that the hand can find them without looking.

Combos are embraced where there is no better way to provide some functionality (quite often). 

Tap hold is absent from regular character keys as it causes an annoying delay which is visible and annoying. No hold on tapped characters. No tap on mods except when in quick succession OR to go back to normal state.

Many combos for symbols and other buttons are placed symetrically (or so) under both hands. I recommend this highly - even for typing with both hands. 
You memorize it easily (and once) and your mind freely chooses depending on which hand's "turn" it is or which hand is less tired. Or the hand opposite to the modifier in use. 
It also allows heavy mouse users to exercise the less-used/less-typing hand a bit more (without memorizing it twice).


The keys under pinkies are in fact ctrl, alt. But when they modify / when used as modifiers for the keys lying on their side, they trigger some common shortcuts instead, as shown on the picture. 
This is to provide (navigation) when other hand is on mouse or holding tea. This must be the hackiest thing on the planet... 
To cancel the overrides you additionally hold Space (so ctrl+Space+s gives ctrl+s; alt+Space+a gives alt+a). 
Additionally, for the right hand only, holding any other modifier also/already cancels the override (ie alt+ctrl+a gives alt+ctrl+a). This took me many years to understand.

However, with the UU now being at index I imagine this comes across as the two vowels are now at index finger, the hand feels more mobile.
