# double_podium WIP

Mouse-friendly symmetrical ortholinear keyboard layout implemented in QMK

## Goals

Mouse friendly, i.e. most actions, characters and symbols are under left hand. If needed, they are then also provided in a more convenient way ivolving both hands. 
And additionally, navigation, common shortcuts and others are also available for right hand-only operation, often by mirroring the left hand. 

No Tap-Hold on regular keys as I believe it's not without issues. I use Tap-Hold on combos, though, as these are pressed slower anyway.

## Concepts

Two sets of arrow keys in the familiar "podium" or "WASD" shape. Press modifier under pinkie to enable. I believe this is more natural than thumb + podium (of the same hand). Read below about the complications.


<!-- 

Combos are embraced where there is no better way to provide some functionality (quite often). 

Tap hold is absent from regular character keys as it causes an annoying delay which is visible and annoying. No hold on tapped characters. No tap on mods except when in quick succession OR to go back to normal state.

Many combos for symbols and other buttons are placed symetrically (or so) under both hands. I recommend this highly - even for typing with both hands. 
You memorize it easily (and once) and your mind freely chooses depending on which hand's "turn" it is or which hand is less tired. Or the hand opposite to the modifier in use. 
It also allows heavy mouse users to exercise the less-used/less-typing hand a bit more (without memorizing it twice).


The keys under pinkies are in fact ctrl, alt. But when they modify / when used as modifiers for the keys lying on their side, they trigger some common shortcuts instead, as shown on the picture. 
This is to provide (navigation) when other hand is on mouse or holding tea. This must be the hackiest thing on the planet... 
To cancel the overrides you additionally hold Space (so ctrl+Space+s gives ctrl+s; alt+Space+a gives alt+a). 
Additionally, for the right hand only, holding any other modifier also/already cancels the override (ie alt+ctrl+a gives alt+ctrl+a). This took me many years to understand.

However, with the UU now being at index I imagine this comes across as the two vowels are now at index finger, the hand feels more mobile.
